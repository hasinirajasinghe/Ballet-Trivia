# Ballet-Trivia
## Project Description 

<link to the game>

Ballet Trivia is a game for players(dancers) who wants to test their ballet terminology. Ballet terminology is an important aspect of exams that most dancers have to take, thus a more fun way to learn would be through a game! It is a single-player game that consists of questions of different levels of difficulty, and the goal is to try to score the highest as possible. Players will have the choice to restart the game as many times as they desire after each round, and the questions will be given in a randomized order every round.
## How to Play 

A spin on learning ballet terminology. Goal of the game is to answer as many questions as correctly as possible. All questions are multiple choice questions.

## Problems
A problem I came across is when a user clicks on a levels button, it takes them directly to the questions view without a delay. If a user accidently double clicks instead of doing a signle click, they'll accidently answer the first question due to the timing of the transition from levels view to question display view. I would like to fix out this UI issue at a later time.
